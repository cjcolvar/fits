description: JHOVE is a software framework for format identification, validation, and characterization of digital objects. JHOVE is written in Java. JHOVE does not validate the codestream but it checks the file structure.
usage-note: The FITS tool wrapper uses the provided API. The JHOVE XML output is converted to FITS XML using XSLT. xml/jhove/jhove_xslt_map.xml is used to determine which XSLT to apply for the given identified format. <br><br> Note - For JP2 files the JHOVE output element Transformation indicates whether the compression is lossy or lossless. The transformation values are described in Table A-20 of the JPEG2000 part 1 specification. A value of 0 maps to the 9-7 irreversible (lossy) filter. A value of 1 maps to 5-3 reversible (lossless) filter. This JHOVE element is used by FITS when it outputs the compressionScheme in the image metadata, writing it as JPEG 2000 Lossy or JPEG 2000 Lossless.

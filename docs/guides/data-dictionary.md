### Data dictionary

FITS converts the raw output of each wrapped tool to a structure called FITS XML. [FITS XML schema](http://hul.harvard.edu/ois/xml/xsd/fits/fits_output.xsd) is maintained by Harvard Library.

The FITS Schema also includes additional top-level elements: technicalMetadata, toolOutputType, and statistics.
